            <h2>Background and Education</h2>
            <p>Brianna Morreale has been working in web development and computer science for multiple years. Going to school in Utah, she majored in Computer Science to 
                be able to take on the role of designing and implementing professional web pages. Throughout her educational career, she took on projects that tackled creating
                web design and coding multiple different web pages to adhere to specific requirements for different companies. She has been working with languages such as HTML, CSS, 
                JavaScript, and Java to be able to successfully make well-made pages filled with animation and detail. Some examples of her work and projects can be found below.

                <figcaption>Another project Brianna did in which she created a website to display an article on why dogs tilt their heads. The color usage and
                    the professional photos add to the entire website as a whole.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This project done by Brianna used a table to be able to make a website that would display a schedule of classes. Within the table 
                    are items such as term, time, and classes. Another great use of HTML and proper styling.</figcaption>

            <h2>Working with Stream Team</h2>
            <p>Brianna joined the Stream Team with the vision of making a website that would be liked by many and would showcase interesting entertainment. When discussing the overall
                design, they had all agreed that a slick, dark design would be appealing to viewers' eyes while also matching the aesthetic of the audience watching the videos. In 
                order to create the website, the team had to come together and use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to display what you can currently find on the site. Brianna and the 
                Stream Team felt that the concept of the website would be very popular amongst a younger audience and therefore be easily popularized. In addition, they wanted the 
                ability for their audience to get more out of their website, and thus, the ability to buy a subscription was created. By developing a subscription, the viewers 
                would be able to benefit even more by getting content and even funnier videos that a free account would not be able to see. Brianna overall found the idea of creating
                the website as a whole to be an intricate challenge that would produce a professional outcome that would be needed by many.

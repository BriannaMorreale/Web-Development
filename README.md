# Web-Development

The goal of the project was to create a website based on a fictional company. Our group came up with the company Stream Team and made a website that would allow users to stream short videos. Our team built the HTML and designed all of the CSS ourselves. The wesbite has five main pages with three subpages on the portfolio tab. Each tab contains items like an area to buy a subscription, find FAQs, contact our company, and read our portfolios.
